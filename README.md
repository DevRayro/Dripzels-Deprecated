## Release Notes
</div>

### Summary:

In this update, I've spruced up the place with a slick new UI and tossed in some nifty features to level up your Dripzels experience. ðŸš€

Guess what? We've got a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Dripzels) now! ðŸŽ‰

It's just a $1/month subscription if you feel like throwing some love our way. But no pressure, seriously. The website is and will always be free for you to use. The Patreon is only if you wish to support the site because, well, it costs me $15/year and hours of caffeine-fueled coding sessions to keep the site up, so your support means a lot to me.
